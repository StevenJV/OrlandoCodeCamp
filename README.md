This repo holds demo code from my 2014 Orlando Code Camp talk: _Keeping Your Sanity With User Interface Automation_.

The project's a Visual Studio 2013 solution and uses the C# bindings for WebDriver and the NUnit test runner. The talk is about concepts, more than syntax, with the goal that attendees discuss and apply them to most languages and web automation tools.

To use, change each test to point to the instance of the web project on heroku rather than localhost.
